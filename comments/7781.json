Maybe something like `MenuItem`'s types such as `checkbox` or `separator` it should just be enumerated with string ids.\n\nWhat do you think?\n"

    "body": "Hey folks - not sure if anyone's working on this yet. I've been reading through the macOS docs, and I think implementing this well will be quite a bit of work, but it could probably follow the pattern set by Electron's Menu module. Here's an example of what I think the API could look like, accounting for touch bar `popovers` and `groups`, as well as a few must-haves like customization (default true or false) and custom text / button colors.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\r\nconst bar = TouchBar.buildFromTemplate([\r\n  {\r\n    customizationLabel: 'Skip Track'\r\n    identifier: 'com.myapp.skip-track',\r\n    image: <NativeImage>,\r\n    default: true,\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    identifier: TouchBar.ItemIdentifierFixedSpaceLarge,\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    customizationLabel: 'Play Controls'\r\n    identifier: 'com.myapp.play-controls',\r\n    type: 'group',\r\n    default: true,\r\n    items: [\r\n      {\r\n        customizationLabel: 'Previous'\r\n        identifier: 'com.myapp.play-controls.prev',\r\n        title: 'Prev',\r\n        labelColor: '#fff',\r\n        bezelColor: 'red',\r\n        click: () => { ... }\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        customizationLabel: 'Next'\r\n        identifier: 'com.myapp.play-controls.next',\r\n        title: 'Next',\r\n        click: () => { ... }\r\n      },\r\n    ]\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    customizationLabel: 'Advanced'\r\n    identifier: 'com.myapp.advanced',\r\n    type: 'popover',\r\n    default: false,\r\n    items: [\r\n      {\r\n        customizationLabel: 'Advanced - Mute Audio'\r\n        identifier: 'com.myapp.advanced.mute',\r\n        title: 'Mute Audio',\r\n        click: () => { ... }\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        customizationLabel: 'Advanced - Apply Crossfade'\r\n        identifier: 'com.myapp.advanced.crossfade',\r\n        title: 'Apply Crossfade',\r\n        click: () => { ... }\r\n      },\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n])\r\n\r\nmyEditorArea.addEventListener('focus', () => {\r\n  TouchBar.setActiveTouchBar(bar);\r\n});\r\nmyEditorArea.addEventListener('blur', () => {\r\n  TouchBar.setActiveTouchBar(null);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think the trickiest part is that macOS composes the final touch bar by combining every touch bar in the responder chain, so theoretically if you had something like this (below) where both `my-video-editor` and `my-video-caption` declared touch bars, you'd see the combination of both bars when focused in the caption area:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div id=\"my-video-editor\">\r\n    <textarea id=\"my-video-caption\">\r\n       <!-- user is focused here -->\r\n    </textarea>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think it'd be fine to leave this as an exercise to the reader, but the macOS implementation is pretty sophisticated and \"whitespace-aware\". Doing it right would require more than `Object.assign(barA, barB)`. I think in a first pass, just providing `TouchBar.setActiveTouchBar(bar)` would be good enough, though?\r\n\r\nAlso, anyone know if Chromium is planning to support this on the broader web? Would be a bummer to implement it, only to have them come up with a nice general solution."

    "body": "I got my new MacBook Pro 2016 yesterday and because I have nothing better to do 😆 I started looking into this.  Initial results are promising but there are a few things that still need to be figured out.\r\n\r\nI'm not even close to an API yet but on the JS side I think it will be best to end up with something like.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { TouchBarButton, TouchBarColorPicker, TouchBarSlider, TouchBarLabel } from 'electron';\r\n\r\nmainWindow.setTouchBar([\r\n  new TouchBarButton({ label: 'My Button', onClick: fn }),\r\n  new TouchBarSlider({ onChange: fn });\r\n]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow to answer a few things:\r\n> Also, anyone know if Chromium is planning to support this on the broader web? Would be a bummer to implement it, only to have them come up with a nice general solution.\r\n\r\nLast I checked Chromium wanted to keep the TouchBar a trusted space.  I.e. No website content / extension content.  So I doubt a web friendly API is coming from that direction any time soon 👍 \r\n\r\n> I think in a first pass, just providing TouchBar.setActiveTouchBar(bar) would be good enough, though?\r\n\r\nRead up above as well, but we need to be setting the active touch bar at a window level not an App level.  Also I think that providing DOM level TouchBar cascading is out of scope of the first run (as you said) and maybe even something that should be handled on the JS side by apps rather than offered by Electron.  There would be many ways users would want it to work so would probably be better off just letting them manipulate an array how they want to.\r\n\r\n>     image: <NativeImage>,\r\n\r\nI haven't even tried to passing a `NativeImage` to a custom item.  Could be fun 😆 \r\n\r\n> few must-haves like customization \r\n\r\nCustomization is gonna be a fun one (and this is also gonna pop a hole in your API idea).  Basically to create in order to generate the TouchBar a method is called on your `NSTouchBarDelegate` called `makeItemForIdentifier`.  You get passed an identifier and have to generate a `NSTouchBarItem`.  This means we can't let the users assign their own identifiers.  The workaround I have is assigning each `TouchBarItem` created on the JS side a unique JS id and then attending that to standard identifiers.  So for instance at the moment the button identifier is `com.electron.tb.button`, when a new button is created it is assigned the identifier `com.electron.tb.button.1`.  This allows us to correctly create the `NSTouchBarItem` and also use that number from the identifier to fetch the extra settings (color, text, size, Etc.).\r\n\r\nIt's definitely going to be a long road to get this working nicely though 👍 \r\n\r\nEDIT:  I've gotten to the point where this is working\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmainWindow.setTouchBar(new TouchBar([\r\n  new (TouchBar.Button)({\r\n    label: 'Foo bar',\r\n    click: () => {\r\n      console.log('Foo bar clicked')\r\n    }\r\n  })\r\n]))\r\n```"

    "body": "@Airhogs777 @sunjay I suppose adding an abstraction layer is fine **if** other operating systems jump on the TouchBar train. But at the moment, there's no need for abstraction.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\nWatching the Microsoft strategy clearly shows us that they are pushing for \"all-touch\" desktop computing. Universal OS for desktop and tablets, Surface , Surface Studio, ... I don't see a TouchBar fit in there nicely.\r\n\r\nThe Linux/Unix based desktop environment maintainers would have to add TouchBar support for their OS running on Apple hardware. If they are clever (and they are) they are certainly going to avoid using any other API method signatures than Apple.\r\n\r\nAs long Microsoft does not add OS-level support for TouchBar + SDK, no other hardware producer but Apple will release any device."

    "body": "I’ve always felt like the electron’s TouchBar api itself is highly developer unfriendly. TouchBar feels more like a UI element that you want to change depending on the state of your app and respond to it (dispatch actions, set state,…) and communicating via `ipc`, having to mount and dismount events might be a bit confusing for an inexperienced dev and makes it harder to have more layouts. \r\n\r\nDefining it in components of your app would allow it to respond to the state more easier. I made a small [library](https://github.com/patrikholcak/react-touchbar-electron) (shameless plug) that allows developers to define TouchBar using React components, but I’m thinking that it might be easier to just port the current api to renderer process (which would also make it library agnostic) and have it communicate via `ipc` for you, AKA:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// ui-component.js\r\nclass App {\r\n  constructor() {\r\n    new TouchBar({\r\n      items: [\r\n        new TouchBarButton({\r\n          click: this.doSomething\r\n        }),\r\n        new TouchBarSlider({}),\r\n        …\r\n      ],\r\n      escapeItem: new TouchBarButton({…})\r\n    })\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCould this be interesting enough for a library/PR?"
