    "body": "Sorry but I don't agree with you.\nThere is a URL in the page,just written like this : `<link rel=\"icon\" href=\"{favicon link}\">`\n\nFor example, you can see such code:`<link rel=\"icon\" type=\"image/x-icon\" href=\"https://assets-cdn.github.com/favicon.ico\">` when viewing the source code of https://github.com/atom/atom-shell/issues/1079. That's GitHub's favicon URL.\n\nOr Stackoverflow: `<link rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"//cdn.sstatic.net/stackoverflow/img/favicon.ico?v=038622610830\">`\n\nSometimes there may not have a URL in the page, as you mentioned. Browsers may handle it by requesting `/favicon.ico`, I guess. like: [baidu](http://www.baidu.com). This page does not include the favicon url in the source code, so the default one `/favicon.ico` is available.\n"

    "body": "Thanks.  That is news to me.\n\nSo having the url in the page speeds things up a bit. It removes the\npossible need to search several places.  Not much speedup though because\nyou still have to load a file either way.  And your code has to be prepared\nfor either case.  And the server still needs to host in the old place for\nold browsers.\n\nIt is great that you can use a better file name and location.  The old IE\nstandard always bothered me.\n"
