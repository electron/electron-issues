The actual sending of the crash report kept failing at https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/atom/common/crash_reporter/win/crash_service.cc#L446 with \"network issue\". Am not sure if this a problem with my environment.\r\n\r\nCan you try and see what you get?\r\n\r\nAs a next step, I tried calling `crash_service::Main` directly from `AtomBindings::StartCrashReporter` so that users do not need to do https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/8109/commits/18d91d6a0a739588b03306e0aad311811e3fdd1b\r\n\r\nDoing so will run `crash_service::Main` in the same child process.\r\nThis doesn't work because `crash_service::Main` is expected to be run in a process separate from the process that is being monitored for crashes.\r\n"
