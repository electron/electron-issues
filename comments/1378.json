    "body": "I give a solution for someone who cannot access to the main process, for example,maybe you try to write a Atom Editor Plugin.\r\nThanks all,my solution combine \"window.onbeforeunload\" and  webview tag 's will-navigate event.\r\nIt makes the \"will-navigate\" event on webview works synchronously.\r\n\r\n*main.js* means the plugin or you make the webview tag, and *preload.js* means the script preload to the webview:\r\n\r\n## main.js\r\n\r\n```js \r\n  let webview = document.createElement(\"webview\");\r\n\r\n webview.preload = \"./preload.js\";\r\n\r\nwebview.addEventListener('dom-ready', () => {\r\n      webview.send('patchToCloud');\r\n      webview.openDevTools();\r\n\r\n      /* 禁用跳转. */\r\n      webview.send(\"enable-jump\",false);\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    webview.addEventListener('will-navigate', ({url}) => {\r\n      /* 处理跳转. */\r\n      console.log(\"original url:\" + webview.src);\r\n      console.log(\"target url:\" + url);\r\n\r\n      /* 可以跳转到一个新的界面. */\r\n      webview.src = \"http://www.apicloud.com\";\r\n      // webview.src = url;\r\n\r\n      /* 如果不跳转,需要显式再一次禁用跳转,以便于下一次能继续正确处理跳转. */\r\n      // webview.send(\"enable-jump\",false);\r\n    });\r\n```\r\n\r\n## preload.js\r\n\r\n```js\r\n  const {ipcRenderer} = require('electron');\r\n\r\n  ipcRenderer.on('enable-jump', (event,enable)=>{\r\n    console.log(enable);\r\n\r\n    if (enable) { // 允许跳转.\r\n      window.onbeforeunload = undefined;\r\n    }else{\r\n      window.onbeforeunload = ()=>{\r\n             /* 因为ipc是异步的,所以此处必须提前取消 onbeforeunload 监听,\r\n              否则有极大概率无法在 webview 监听的 will-navigate 事件里进行跳转.\r\n             */\r\n             window.onbeforeunload = undefined;\r\n             return 'will navigate...';\r\n         };\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n```"
