Basically you just need to rebuild your native modules (in this case `java`) with Electron's headers.\r\n\r\nThis is actually super easy.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm i electron-rebuild --save-dev\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen add a script \"rebuild-modules\" to your package.json\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  ...\r\n  \"scripts: {\r\n    ...\r\n    \"rebuild-modules\": \"electron-rebuild\"\r\n    ...\r\n  }\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen simply  run `npm run rebuild-modules`"

    "body": "@dasarindam @vrmerlin I took a quick look into this.  It looks like the `java` module does something it really shouldn't.\r\n\r\nIt relies on the `postinstall` phase being run immediately after rebuild.  This is not always the case, especially when rebuilding modules for Electron.  You should raise an issue regarding this on the `node-java` repository.\r\n\r\nFor now, a workaround is as follows. (Extending on my sample before)\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm install java\r\nnpm run rebuild-modules\r\nnode node_modules/java/postInstall.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should get your `java` module working 👍 "

My hunch is that your one of the steps I've outlined above is failing with some error, so you aren't actually getting a full build, and thus no DLL file. I'd remove all the node_modules content, and do each step, reviewing closely for any errors along the way."
