Also blocking of moving and resizing is recommended.\n\nI'll think of the best way to add this to Electron and send you a pull request.\n"

    "body": "@zcbenz Could you (or someone) please help me. I've already done this for OS X and now I'm trying to achieve this on Windows. After that I'll send a PR. But there's a little problem. \n\nThe size of my screen is 1440x900. I'm creating a BrowserWindow with params:\n\n``` javascript\n{ x: 0, y: 0, width: 1440, height: 900 }\n```\n\nTo make the window topmost, I call `::SetWindowPos(GetAcceleratedWidget(), HWND_TOPMOST, x, y, width, height, 0)`, it's working fine.\n\nOn these lines (`native_window_views.cc:127`) the `widget_size_` is 1440x900 as expected:\n\n``` c++\ngfx::Rect bounds(0, 0, width, height);\nwidget_size_ = bounds.size();\n```\n\nBut then `NativeWindowViews::OnWidgetBoundsChanged` fires and sets height to `860`. I guess that 40px that is gone is a taskbar. As a result, the window is not overlapping the taskbar.\n\nBut if I do a dirty hack and reset window size like this:\n\n``` c++\nNativeWindow::SetSize(bounds.size())\n```\n\nin the end of `NativeWindowViews` constructor, then the window overlaps everything.\n\nSo basically the problem is that something somewhere shrinks the bounds after the window is created, I'm not an expert in Electron's code, do you know what is it and how to prevent it doing this?\n"
