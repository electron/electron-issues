That means there's basically two ways to fix this:\n- ask React to add valid attributes (not really future-proof + unsure they would accept that)\n- let Electron support `data-*` variants for nonstandard attributes like partition, useragent, etc.\n\nThe second one would make my life much easier. Does it seem feasible without cluttering electron's codebase too much? (I'm blissfully unaware of that part of electron's internals for now).\n\nIf neither solutions are adopted, then it'd probably be worth a note in the documentation — I suppose I'm not the only one using the electron/react/webview combo.\n"
