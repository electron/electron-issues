But didn't seem to work.\n\nSo I think there are these options:\n1. Not set a `BrowserWindow` icon, but then it uses some [default icon](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/430293/5693807/429fe9ee-98fd-11e4-9921-820fed123c3f.png) that doesn't look that great.\n2. Use a high res icon, but then it looks pixelated in the window\n3. Use a `16px` icon, but then the taskbar icon looks pixelated\n4. Use a `32px` icon. Looks not perfect but okay-ish in both, window and taskbar.\n\nDoing 4. is probably the best compromise for now.\n\nps. Something interesting is that once you right-click and \"pin\" an icon in the taskbar, it switches to the `ico` which looks perfect.\n"
